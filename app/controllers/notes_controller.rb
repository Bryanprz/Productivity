        # 1. name of channel to which we are broadcasting
        # 2. Some content that will be sent through the channel as JSON
        #      'note:' set to the description of the note we just created
        #      There is nothing special about the 'note' key here. We can structure
        #      or label the data we want to send across the channel any way we like,
        #      as long as we tell our subscriber to access that data in accordance
        #      with how we structure it here.

        # ActionCable uses Redis to send and receive notes over the channel.
        # So when we tell ActionCable server to #broadcast to 'notes', we're actually
        # saying "send new notes to the 'notes' channel maintained by Redis."
        # Redis is the data store that ensures all notes are in sync across instances
        # of the application.

        # This broadcasts the ActiveRecord object @note to the 'notes' channel. Here we're just sending data from the database to the channel. The NotesChannel is responsible for streaming this data to its subscribers.
